In the last overview, we learned that Smart Contracts on the Blockchain, Javascript Web Components stored on the chain and Gateways rendering Components work together to make the Blockchain Operating System.

Now we are going to work on making a custom Gateway and VM build, at the end we will build a simple analytics gateway powered by the decentralized frontend applications on the BOS.

Steps Overview:

1. Find a suitable Gateway Boilerplate.
2. Find a compatible VM to the Gateway.
3. Create a widget on the BOS that fits our frontend.
4. Gateway: Customize the main page's widget into our desired widget created.
5. VM: start adding required libraries that can be accessed and used by the components on the BOS.
6. Build and Deploy
